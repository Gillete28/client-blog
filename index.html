  <p> Some specific benefits of yoga that affect the overall health + mental functioning + creativity have been studied recently by scientists, doctors, psychiatrists and psychologists, theologians, philosophers and artists. Yoga, including both its physical side and meditation techniques, is the subject of numerous university level courses in the East and in the West. Yoga is practiced and extensively used in hospitals and other medical establishments as a complementary healing method, a way to eliminate or alleviate pain and suffering, for prevention or for recuperation and restoration of health. The discipline of “yoga therapy” or yoga chikitsa is quickly gaining ground in the West. Non-invasive, gentle and even pleasant ways to restore our health with a combination of postures, breathing and cleansing techniques, and meditation, are used to treat the ailments and diseases of cardio-circulatory, respiratory, nervous, digestive, skeleton-muscular, and reproductive systems. Yoga therapy is also used for the treatment of excessive weight and obesity, environment and stress-induced health problems, depression and everyday de-stressing of body and mind.</p>

    <p>Refine the breath. Close your lips and breathe in and out only through your nose. Breathing out through your nostrils is the most energy efficient way to breathe. The lungs harness our primary source of energy, breath. Breath equals prana. Prana is our powerful life force that transcends all cultures, genders and colors. Prana is the force we all share. The breath is so powerful. The best way to harness the power of our breath is through our nostrils. Inhale and exhale through your nose when you practice yoga. Our nostrils are excellent at controlling the amount of air we release on the exhale, so lungs have more time to extract the oxygen. It creates a better balance of oxygen carbon dioxide exchange and maintains a more balanced pH level in the blood. Better oxygenated blood means more energy and a better functioning body. This is a great benefit that yoga breathing provides.</p>
    <p>Move. Movement is the key to living. If we stop moving we get tight, stiff and angry. Let’s start to move slowly and mindfully. Inhale arms up overhead and strengthen your legs by squeezing thighs and lifting your knee caps. With soft knees bend at the waist and touch the floor with your fingertips. In lift your head and your heart forward and the fold again. Inhale and make your legs strong. Reach both arms up to the sky. Slowly circle your arms back to prayer hands at heart center. Repeat 5 times. Feel Better?</p>
